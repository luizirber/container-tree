# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes (recipe file format? image file format?)
 - migration guidance (how to convert images?)
 - changed behaviour (recipe sections work differently)

The versions coincide with releases on pip. Only major versions will be released as tags on Github.

## [0.0.x](https://github.com/singularityhub/container-tree/tree/master) (0.0.x)
 - (not yet released) added Collection Trees (0.0.x)
 - restructuring tree.py to be module with more tree types (0.0.05)
 - adding ability to load tree from list or dictionary (0.0.04)

 - added tree visualization (with demo) and get_count and insert (0.0.02)
