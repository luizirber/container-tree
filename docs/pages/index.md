**Container Trees**

Container Tree implements data structures and methods for visualization,
comparison, and analysis using one or more 
[linux containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_containers).
It can help you not only to see inside a container, but to implement
tools for searching, extracting data from, comparing, and generally
better understanding one or more containers.
